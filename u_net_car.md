# U-Net for Self driving car

## Datasets

CamVid Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlolepelaars/camvid

The Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) provides ground truth labels that associate each pixel with one of 32 semantic classes. This dataset is often used in (real-time) semantic segmentation research.

The dataset is split up as follows:

    367 training pairs
    101 validation pairs
    233 test pairs


## Code:


[Tensorflow Implementation](/u_net_for_self_driving_cars.ipynbu_net)  <br>
Referred from Kaggle


## Accuracy: </br>
Data was trained on google co-lab for 500 epochs</br>
Accuracy was around 75%
Accuracy can be improved by having more datasets
